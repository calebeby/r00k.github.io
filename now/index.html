<h1 class="headline">What I'm doing now</h1>

<p>I live in Boston. I spend pretty much all my time doing these things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>My day job is running and trying to grow <a href="https://formkeep.com">FormKeep</a>.</li>
  <li>Each week, I publish <a href="http://giantrobots.fm">a podcast</a> where I discuss my work on FormKeep.</li>
  <li>I go on a lot of dates trying to find an awesome partner. I love being set up, so if you know any smart, funny, capable ladies (or are one yourself), don't be shy!</li>
  <li>I sing bass in a <a href="http://downtowncrossingquartet.com">barbershop quartet</a>.</li>
  <li>I use <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> to manage my day-to-day todos.</li>
  <li>I track my big-picture 2016 goals using <a href="https://medium.com/keep-learning-keep-growing/the-4-part-system-ive-used-for-4-years-to-achieve-10x-productivity-40ec9e3c770e">this system</a>.</li>
  <li>I attempt to stay in shape by alternating kettlebell workouts and vinyasa yoga.</li>
</ul>
