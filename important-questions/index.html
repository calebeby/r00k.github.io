<h1 class="centered">Questions from Clem and Jasper (3/16/17)</h1>

<h3>Clem's Questions</h3>

<h4>How many children do you want?</h4> 

<p>Three sounds ideal. Two would probably also be great. I think kids should have siblings, so one is pretty much out.</p>

<h4>What will your career be like?</h4> 

<p>I'm not sure, but I will definitely prioritize freedom. I find my work interesting and fulfilling, but it isn't the most important thing to me (more on that later).</p>

<h4>How do you plan your kids childhood?</h4> 

<p>I hope to teach my kids how to be happy. I'm okay with whatever kind of childhood leads them in that direction.</p>

<h4>Will you do laundry and dishes?</h4> 

<p>Sure! I sort of enjoy cleaning up. It's satisfying.</p>

<h4>How often will you take H out to dinner?</h4> 

<p>I think it's important to take your person out for dates even if you've been together for a long time, so probably pretty often.</p>

<h4>What is your storyboard for your life?</h4> 

<p>I'm not sure, but the most important thing to me is spending as much time as possible with people I love.</p>

<h4>Are you a picky eater?</h4> 

<p>I like almost anything that was prepared well.</p>

<h4>Do you play any physical activities?</h4> 

<p>I play squash, which is like indoor tennis. You get to wear cool goggles and make lots of noise.</p>

<h4>Do you want to travel places?</h4> 

<p>I do, but I prefer to stay somewhere for a while once I get there.</p>

<h4>Do you like white wine or red wine?</h4>

<p>White and rose in the summer. Red otherwise.</p>


<h3>Jasper's Questions </h3> 

<h4>Are you addicted to any drugs?</h4> 

<p>Nope!</p>

<h4>Do you want your kids to be smart?</h4> 

<p>That'd be great.</p>

<h4>You know like very smart?</h4>

<p>Oh, I know. And yes.</p>

<h4>Like overly smart?</h4> 

<p>I'm not sure that's a thing! Is there a downside to getting too smart? I'm not convinced there is.</p>

<h4>Do you like microbrews (they're too hipster for me buttttt..)</h4>

<p>I like the first three sips of beer. After that I prefer whiskey.</p>
